# 42 Minishell Project

Minishell

As the name implies, this project is about creating a simple shell in C, taking bash as a reference. Impementation of clasic bash written completely from scratch with Yusuf Anıl Turgut as part of 42 Ciriculum.

  * This custom shell has most of the features from original bash like custom enironment, builtins, pipes, multiple redirections, logical operators and parenthesis, signal and error      handling.
  * It works by geting input from user. Then dividing it into tokens. Then parsing it into varios data structures and executing.

# Change directory to the project directory and compile;
$ cd minishell && make

# To run the shell, simply execute the following command:
